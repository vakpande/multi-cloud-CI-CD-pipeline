Project Outline: Multi-Cloud CI/CD Pipeline

Overview
This project provides an automated CI/CD pipeline that can deploy applications across multiple cloud providers (AWS, Azure, GCP). It ensures seamless deployment, scaling, and rollback with Terraform, Kubernetes, and Helm.

Key Features
✅ Multi-cloud support (AWS, Azure, GCP)
✅ Terraform-based Infrastructure provisioning
✅ Helm-based Kubernetes deployment
✅ GitOps-style CI/CD with GitHub Actions/Jenkins
✅ Automated rollbacks on failure
✅ Service Mesh integration (Istio/Linkerd)
✅ Security & Compliance enforcement
Tech Stack
CI/CD: GitHub Actions / Jenkins / GitLab CI
Infrastructure as Code: Terraform
Orchestration: Kubernetes (EKS, AKS, GKE)
Packaging: Helm
Security: HashiCorp Vault, OPA (Open Policy Agent)
Monitoring: Prometheus, Grafana, Loki
Now, here’s the README.md for the project:

🔹 Introduction

This project enables multi-cloud continuous integration and deployment with Kubernetes, Terraform, and Helm. It automates deployments across AWS (EKS), Azure (AKS), and GCP (GKE) while enforcing security and compliance policies.

📐 Architecture

Components:
Terraform → Provisions cloud infrastructure (EKS, AKS, GKE)
GitHub Actions/Jenkins → Automates CI/CD pipeline
Docker & Helm → Package and deploy applications
Kubernetes (EKS, AKS, GKE) → Container orchestration
Prometheus & Grafana → Monitoring & Alerts
Vault & OPA → Security & Compliance
⚡ Prerequisites

GitHub / GitLab account
Terraform (>=1.0.0)
Helm (>=3.0.0)
AWS, Azure, and GCP CLI configured
Kubernetes (>=1.22)
Install dependencies:

brew install terraform helm kubectl awscli azure-cli gcloud
🚀 Installation

Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/multi-cloud-cicd.git
cd multi-cloud-cicd
Set up environment variables
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID="your-aws-key"
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY="your-aws-secret"
export AZURE_CLIENT_ID="your-azure-client-id"
export AZURE_TENANT_ID="your-azure-tenant-id"
export GCP_PROJECT="your-gcp-project"
Provision infrastructure using Terraform
terraform init
terraform apply -auto-approve
🎯 Usage

CI/CD Workflow
Developer pushes code → GitHub Actions/Jenkins triggers build
Docker image is built and pushed to container registry
Helm chart is deployed to Kubernetes cluster
Automated tests run post-deployment checks
If health checks fail, rollback is triggered
🔧 Infrastructure Deployment

Deploy Kubernetes clusters using Terraform:

cd terraform
terraform apply -auto-approve
This sets up: ✅ EKS (AWS), AKS (Azure), GKE (GCP)
✅ IAM roles, security groups
✅ Networking (VPCs, Subnets, Firewalls)

📦 Application Deployment

Deploy an application using Helm:

helm upgrade --install my-app ./helm-chart --namespace my-namespace
🔄 Rollback Strategy

If the deployment fails, use Helm rollback:

helm rollback my-app 1
OR restore previous infrastructure:

terraform destroy -auto-approve
📊 Monitoring & Logging

Prometheus & Grafana → Metrics monitoring
Loki & Fluentd → Centralized logging
Jaeger → Tracing microservices
Deploy monitoring stack:

kubectl apply -f monitoring-stack.yaml
